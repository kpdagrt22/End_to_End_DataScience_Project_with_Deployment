# 🧠 End-to-End Data Science Project with Modular ML Pipeline

This project implements a complete, production-ready machine learning pipeline using best practices in data science engineering. It covers the full lifecycle: from data ingestion to model evaluation, all managed through configuration files and modular code.

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

```
Raw Data → Data Ingestion → Data Validation → Data Transformation → Model Training → Model Evaluation
```

## 🔧 Key Pipeline Stages

### ✅ Data Ingestion
- Fetches raw data from local/remote sources.
- Saves data to the designated artifacts folder.

### ✅ Data Validation
- Validates dataset structure and schema using `schema.yaml`.
- Checks for missing values, data types, and expected ranges.

### ✅ Data Transformation
- Cleans, scales, encodes, and prepares features.
- Handles outliers, imputation, and feature engineering.

### ✅ Model Training
- Trains a machine learning model using hyperparameters from `params.yaml`.
- Saves model artifacts and training logs.

### ✅ Model Evaluation
- Evaluates the trained model on validation/test sets.
- Logs metrics using **MLflow** and optionally integrates with **DagsHub**.

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

- **config.yaml** – Paths and settings for each pipeline stage.
- **params.yaml** – Hyperparameters for training models.
- **schema.yaml** – Rules and structure for validating raw data.

All configurations are managed using a centralized configuration manager (`src/config`).

---

## 🔍 Experiment Tracking

- **MLflow**: Tracks experiments, metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- **Dagshub** *(optional)*: Remote platform for version control and ML experiment tracking.
